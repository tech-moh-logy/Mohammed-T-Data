# Driver's Choice:
**Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch),  Predictive Modeling, Statistical Analysis, Python, Data Engineering with SQL & Excel**: [Fuel Cost & Efficiency: A Statistical & Machine Learning Approach to Driver's Decision-Making | Driver's Choice:  Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/Mohammed-Tiger-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Highlander-Data-Analysis/mohammedTiger.compareHighlanders.dataAnalysis.pdf): Ahmed slashed his gas bill by up to $15,000 in just 4 years ($312.50 per month!)â€”and his success inspired 30 other taxi drivers in NYC to do the same. This data-driven comparative analysis of gas expenses and efficiency between Non-Hybrid and Hybrid Toyota Highlanders leverages predictive analytics to estimate potential savings. Our model forecasts up to $15,000 in gas cost reductions per driver over a 20-month period post-purchase, leading to an aggregated projected savings of $900,000 across the driver cohort. [See how it works](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/Mohammed-Tiger-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Highlander-Data-Analysis/mohammedTiger.compareHighlanders.dataAnalysis.pdf)! 
- **Data Collection Process**: For this analysis, I collected my own data over a span of <b>seven weeks</b>, focusing on gas expenses, mileage, driving habits, etc. The data collection process involved manual recording. By collecting firsthand data, I aimed to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the analysis to my specific research questions and objectives.
