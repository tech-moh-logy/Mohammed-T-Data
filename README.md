## Driver's Choice: 
Our predictive model doesn’t just help NYC taxi drivers save $13K–$15K per year in fuel costs. By optimizing vehicle selection, it frees up drivers’ finances to invest in other areas, from improving their vehicles to supporting their families or investing in savings. Beyond financial benefits, this approach reduces fuel consumption, contributing to lower emissions and a greener environment. The model also improves overall operational efficiency, helping drivers make more informed decisions, and increases their long-term profitability. With $500K+ in total savings over 4 years, this project demonstrates both immediate financial gains and sustainable impacts for individual drivers, the city, and the environment.

**Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch),  Predictive Modeling, Statistical Analysis, Python, Data Engineering with SQL & Excel**: [Fuel Cost & Efficiency: A Statistical & Machine Learning Approach to Driver's Decision-Making | Driver's Choice:  Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/Mohammed-Tiger-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Highlander-Data-Analysis/mohammedTiger.compareHighlanders.dataAnalysis.pdf): Ahmed slashed his gas bill by up to $15,000 in just 4 years ($312.50 per month!)—and his success inspired 30 other taxi drivers in NYC to do the same. This data-driven comparative analysis of gas expenses and efficiency between Non-Hybrid and Hybrid Toyota Highlanders leverages predictive analytics to estimate potential savings. Our model forecasts up to $15,000 in gas cost reductions per driver over a 20-month period post-purchase, leading to an aggregated projected savings of $500,000 across the driver cohort. [See how it works](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/Mohammed-Tiger-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Highlander-Data-Analysis/mohammedTiger.compareHighlanders.dataAnalysis.pdf)! 
- **Data Collection Process**: For this analysis, I collected my own data over a span of <b>seven weeks</b>, focusing on gas expenses, mileage, driving habits, etc. The data collection process involved manual recording. By collecting firsthand data, I aimed to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the analysis to my specific research questions and objectives.
> *Thank you, Mohammed! I can't believe this, yaar! I was little scared for hybrid, you know, new technology and all. But the money I save every month, oh my god, it's too much, man!*
> 
> *Tumhe pata nahi yaar, hybrid lene se gas kitna save ho raha hai! Pehle jo paisa har mahine gas par jaata tha, ab wo bacha ke rakhta hoon!*
>
> *$400 bach gaya har mahina aur koi shor nahi! Best decision, bhai! Pichhe socha, yeh karte to achha hota. 15 saal se NYC mein chala raha hoon! Nahi jaana tha ki itna paisa bachaya jaa sakta hai.*
