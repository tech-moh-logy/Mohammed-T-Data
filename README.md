**Python & SQL**: [Comparative Analysis of Gas Expenses and Efficiency](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/Mohammed-Tiger-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Highlander-Data-Analysis/mohammedTiger.dataAnalysis.highlanders.pdf): Ahmed slashed his gas bill by up to $15,000 in 4 years - and his success inspired 20 others to follow suit! Together, they're projected to <b>save a whopping $400,000</b> on gas over four years. [See how it works](https://github.com/tech-moh-logy/Mohammed-Tiger-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Highlander-Data-Analysis/mohammedTiger.dataAnalysis.highlanders.pdf)!
